# MaximizedHustleROI
Algorithm Analysis Final Project

General Problem:
Based on a list of tasks, create a schedule that maximizes the reward
Maximizing return on investment (ROI)​

Dyanmic Programming Algorithm:
Stores and solves the subproblems, then combine their solutions to solve original problem​
Loop through the tasks, storing the non-conflicting tasks that have the highest reward​
Sort of like Longest Common Subsequence​
Time complexity is O(n2)​
